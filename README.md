# How to sign-up for the foundry battle
As some people were confused about the sign-up process of the foundry battle and I got annoyed, I decided to create a tutorial how I want you to register to the foundry battle.
## Time voting
In the first step you will be able to vote for times that the foundry battle could take place at. Please select EVERY time that is possible for you to attend. NOT JUST YOUR PREFERRED TIME!!!
## Final registration
After the time voting finished, I will set up the foundry times according to the voting results. Then you will be able to send battle requests for Legion 1 or 2. Please check the time for each legion BEFORE sending a battle request for it. When your requested time is the same as the one you initially voted for, you might be added to the legion. If the times don't match, write an direct message to SpiderPen (name might be not up to date at all times, ask a R4/5 for the current name) and explain why you can participate at a time you didn't vote for.
## After registration ends
When the registration process is finished, your final foundry time will be shown on the task list. If you are unsure about your time, write another direct message to SpiderPen (name might be not up to date at all times, ask a R4/5 for the current name) and ask.
