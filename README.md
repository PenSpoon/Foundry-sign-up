# How to sign-up for the foundry battle
As some people were confused about the sign-up process of the foundry battle, I decided to create a tutorial on how I want you to register to the foundry battle.


## Time voting
In the first step you will be able to vote for times that the foundry battle could take place at.<br/>
**Please select EVERY time that is possible for you to attend. NOT JUST YOUR PREFERRED TIME!!!**

## Final registration
After the time voting finished, I will set up the foundry times according to the voting results. Then you will be able to send battle requests for Legion 1 or 2.<br/>
Please check the time for each legion **BEFORE** sending a battle request for it. 

**--Visual support (screenshots) will follow soon™--**

When your requested time is the same as the one you initially voted for, you will be added to the legion in a **FIRST COME FIRST SERVE** system.<br/>
If the times **don't match**, write an direct message to SpiderPen (name might be not up to date at all times, ask a R4/5 for the current name) and explain why you can participate at a time you didn't vote for.


## After registration ends
When the registration process is finished, your final foundry time will be shown on the task list.<br/>
If you are unsure about your time, write another direct message to SpiderPen (name might be not up to date at all times, ask a R4/5 for the current name) and ask.
